Why? Comedy, really. Inspiration / benchmark is this tumbler post and youtube video

There are ways to do this online for paragraphs.

I added a intensity value that will only insert and replace sometimes.

I had to write custom replace function because standard replace would just do everything. I am not confident that it will work 100% of the time, so if you run into issues let me know and report it.

Good enough for a sunday comedy project though, so whatever.
